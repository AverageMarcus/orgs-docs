OrgsThis is a top-level introduction to Orgs. If you already know what Orgs are\nand want to get up and running, you should jump ahead to \"Getting Started\".\n\n\n\nOrgs is a tool for organization, both of packages and teams of developers.\nIt was created out of the need by many package publishers to handle\nlarge numbers of contributors over a set of many packages.Organizing PackagesCreating an organization on npm gives you an organization scope under\nwhich you can have your own namespace for packages. The organization\nscope is the name of the organization, as registered on npm. For\nexample, if your organization is called \"the best\", you would register\nas \"the-best\" and get a scope, @the-best. From there, you could name\nyour packages whatever you want (according to our guidelines).Scopes are great for many reasons, some examples:maintain a fork of a package, e.g. @the-best/request\n\navoiding name disputes with popular names, e.g. @the-best/cat\n\nimproving internal discovery of organization supported packages\n(they're all in a single namespace!)\n\nWhile you get a scope by default when registering as an Org, that doesn't\nmean you have to use it. In fact, you can use Orgs to manage unscoped\npackages, or even packages under a different scope, such as a user scope,\ne.g. @ag_dubs/hello, where ag_dubs is an npm user.Organizing PeopleThe real benefit of Orgs is that it makes it better, and in some cases,\nsimply possible, to manage access and visibility of packages across\na large team of contributors.When using Orgs, you organize your developers into Teams. You can then\ngrant team permissions (read/write) to packages you govern, which then\ncascades to all members of that team. By doing this, you can have certain\nteams that develop a package (write access) and then some teams that can use\nthat package (read access). You can do this for all of the packages that\nthe organization governs, public unscoped packages and public/private\nscoped packages alike.What does Orgs cost?Orgs are free if your organization only has public packages.If your organization needs to also publish and install private packages,\nan Org will cost you $7/user/month, for all users."},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Startednpm Organizations are a great way to [manage access to packages], particularly\nif you are collaborating 3 or more people. This page will teach you how to\nnavigate the web interface to create an npm Organization.\n\n\n\n\n1. Sign up for an npm Account and Log InTo create an Organization, you need to login to the npm website. Don't have\nan npm user account? No problem, you can sign up for one here.2. Create an OrganizationOnce you are logged in, navigate to your profile page. From there, you\nshould see three (3) links under the \"Your Account\" heading. Click\n\"create an organization\".If you are already logged in, you can also go directly to\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/org/create.3. Name Your Organization and Choose Your PlanGive your Organization a name! Choose wisely as changing your Organization\nis complicated and requires contacting npm Support. \nLearn more about renaming and/or deleting your Organization.Would you like to convert your current user account to an Organization?\nWant to use your current user scope as an Organization scope?\nLearn more about migrating a user account.Once you've named your Organization, you'll need to choose a plan.\nCurrently, npm offers 2 plans:free: public packages only\n\npaid: install and publish private packages ($7/user/month)\n\nFor example, if you have 3 users, an Organization that only needs public \npackages will be entirely free.
